# Fugg

Translates any text to spurdo (unless it contains itemlinks).

For when you want to type like an idiot, but can't be bothered to.

There are four options:
- /fugg off to disable fugg
- /fugg on to enable fugg
- /fugg chat to toggle regular chatchannel functionality
- /fugg bn to toggle Battle.net whisper functionality
